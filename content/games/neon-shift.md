Neon Shift is a speed-running focused platformer with a twist! Run as fast as you can along the rooftops of Neon City to escape... but who are you running from? Get your time as low as you can and aim for one of the top spots on the leaderboard!

Neon Shift was originally created for the 2023 GMTK game Jam with the theme ‘Roles Reversed’ in mind. We are currently working on expanding and refining the game with the goal of a more substantial steam release, which will include multiple official levels and a community-driven level editor.
