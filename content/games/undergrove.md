Undergrove is a rouguelite, twin-stick shooter in which up to four players must defend their forest shrine from waves of an alien invasion. In order to overcome the hoard, the player will have to make expert use of their boomerang, which can be repeatedly parried to build up a combo that will progressively grant buffs.

Undergrove is still at an early stage because we're currently focused on expanding Neon Shift for its full release, but we're super excited about the potential of the project and can't wait to eventually release a demo!
