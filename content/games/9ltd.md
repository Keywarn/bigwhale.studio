9 Lives to Die is a small action platformer that was created for the 2022 GMTK game jam. You'll need to roll the dice (the theme of the jam) to obtain abilities that will assist you through the dungeon. Making use ofÂ your trusty sword, run and jump your way through the gloomy caverns.

We also produced a [hypothetical design document](https://keywarn.github.io/9LivesToDie/) for further development, but aren't currently working on the project - maybe one day it'll make a return!
