9 Lives to Die is a small action platformer that was created for the 2022 GMTK game jam. You'll need to roll the dice (the theme of the jam) to obtain abilities that will assist you as you run, jump and slash your way through the gloomy caverns.

After finishing the jam, we also produced a [hypothetical design document](https://keywarn.github.io/9LivesToDie/) for further development, but aren't currently working on the project - maybe one day it'll make a return!
